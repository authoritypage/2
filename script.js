# StatStream Dashboard | Personal Analytics & Metric Overview

## Elevating Data Presentation with Native UI Aesthetics

"StatStream Dashboard" is a sophisticated, minimalist web dashboard meticulously crafted to emulate the sleek, intuitive user interfaces found in modern native applications, such as Apple's Stocks or Screen Time widgets. It serves as a prime demonstration of advanced front-end architecture, focusing on elegant data presentation within responsive, card-like modules. This project is built for optimal performance and seamless deployment via GitHub Pages.

### Project Type

Personal Analytics Dashboard / Metric Overview / UI Component Showcase

### Design Philosophy

*   **Native App Inspiration**: Adopts the clean lines, generous use of whitespace, prominent typography, and soft, rounded containers characteristic of modern mobile and desktop interfaces.
*   **Intuitive Data Visualization**: Features a custom-built SVG line chart with a smooth gradient fill (akin to stock charts) for displaying trends, complemented by clear axes and subtle grid lines. Mini-charts enhance smaller data cards.
*   **Metric-Driven Hierarchy**: Large, bold numbers immediately convey key metrics, while supportive details and trend indicators provide context.
*   **Soft Color Palette**: Predominantly white and very light gray backgrounds are accented with a vibrant green for positive trends and clear blues for primary visual elements.
*   **Modular Componentry**: Each data card is designed as a reusable, self-contained component, promoting scalability and maintainability.
*   **Optimized Responsiveness**: The dashboard dynamically rearranges and scales its cards to maintain visual harmony across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Features

*   **Semantic HTML5 Structure**: Clean and logical markup providing a robust foundation.
*   **Sleek Header**: Minimalist header with project title and simple navigation tabs.
*   **Modular Card Layout**: A responsive grid system displays various data insights within aesthetically pleasing, shadowed cards.
*   **Primary Line Chart Module**:
    *   **Custom SVG Rendering**: JavaScript dynamically draws the line chart, including the data line, fill area (with linear gradient), and essential grid lines.
    *   **Dynamic Data Plotting**: Capable of visualizing time-series or numerical trends.
    *   **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover over data points for specific values.
    *   **Responsive Scaling**: The chart intelligently resizes with its container.
*   **Varied Data Card Examples**: Includes different card types:
    *   A 'Screen Time'-inspired summary with categorization (Productivity, Social, Entertainment).
    *   A mini-bar chart for historical usage (e.g., Energy Usage).
    *   A dynamic progress bar for project tracking.
    *   A mini-line chart for sales/revenue growth.
*   **Clear Typography**: Uses `Inter` font, carefully selected for readability and visual impact across various metric sizes.
*   **GitHub Pages Ready**: Includes `.nojekyll` for frictionless deployment.

### Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: The structural backbone of the dashboard cards and overall layout.
*   **CSS3**: Extensive use of Flexbox, CSS Grid, custom properties (variables), subtle box-shadows, and transitions to create the polished, soft UI.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**: Powers all dynamic chart rendering using raw SVG DOM manipulation, data mapping, and responsive chart resizing. Handles minor UI interactions.
*   **SVG**: For scalable, crisp line art in charts and potential icons.
*   **Google Fonts**: `Inter` is chosen for its excellent legibility and modern aesthetic.

### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running for preview or development:

#### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser. Git is recommended for version control and deployment.

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-github-username/statstream-dashboard.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd statstream-dashboard
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. All styles, scripts, and chart data are self-contained.

### Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This project is perfectly tailored for GitHub Pages deployment:

1.  **Create a new GitHub repository** (e.g., `statstream-dashboard`).
2.  **Push your project files** (the contents of the `statstream-dashboard` folder) to this new repository.
3.  **On GitHub.com, navigate to your repository's settings.**
4.  **Under the "Pages" section, select the `main` branch (or your primary branch) as your source** and save.
5.  **Ensure a `.nojekyll` file exists** in the root of your `statstream-dashboard` directory (it's provided).
6.  Your live site will be accessible at `https://your-github-username.github.io/statstream-dashboard/`.

### Customization

*   **Data Integration**: Replace the `mockData` arrays in `script.js` with your own analytics data. Adapt the data processing and scaling functions as needed.
*   **Chart Types**: Extend the SVG drawing functions in `script.js` to create other chart types (e.g., pie charts, stacked bars).
*   **Colors & Branding**: Easily adjust the accent colors (green, blue), background shades, and font stack in `:root` of `style.css` to match your own brand.
*   **Card Content**: Modify the `index.html` to add more custom cards with relevant metrics and unique layouts.
*   **Interactivity**: Enhance `script.js` for dynamic filtering, live data updates, or drill-down functionality within the dashboard.
